	<h3>What is the daily usage?</h3>

	<p>
		Your daily usage is the amount of energy you have used in a day.
	</p>
	</div>
	<div class="faq-item">
	<h3>How do we calculate the daily usage?</h3>

	<p>
		This is calculated by analysing the wattage of each appliance and multiplying it by the number of hours you use it.<br>
		For example, if you have a 150W TV that's on for 5 hours of the day, that would equate to 750 watt-hours per day.

	<div class="faq-item">
	<h3>How do you get your panel details?</h3>

	<p>
		To get the details about your solar panels you're advised to consult your guide if you are given one when they were installed, or you can contact Bushlight or the company who installed your solar panels.
		We ask that you find out the surface area and angle of your panels plus how many there are.
	</p>
	</div>
	<div class="faq-item">
	<h3>What is a Surplus Deficit?</h3>

	<p>
		A Surplus Deficit is when you have more coming in than going out, so in this instance, it means that you have more energy than you are using.
	</p>

	<div class="faq-item">
	<h3>I can't find my town, what should I do?</h3>
